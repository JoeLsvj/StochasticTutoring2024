# Assignments

In this directory you will find all the assignments. 

Completing the assignments is a requirement for taking the exam. We will give you new assignments every week. You need to hand them in before the next tutoring session or, as we will let you know, by the next assignment deadline.

Assignments will also be graded.

Please submit your assignments to my institutional email address: lorenzo.cabriel@studenti.units.it.
